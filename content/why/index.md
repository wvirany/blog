I initially created an academic page to host a portfolio where I could show off my projects to potential employers. However, it quickly turned into a small passion for writing about the things I'm working on. Now, I enjoy maintaining this blog for several reasons:

**First**, I often find myself looking for resources which dumb down complicated research topics or offer helpful career advice. I have benefitted substantially from other academic blogs on the internet, so I maintain this blog in an attempt to contribute to that community[^fn1].

**Second**, the act of writing down the things that I am currently working on in a polished format forces me to refine my understanding of the concepts, and also helps me to develop my writing skills. Furthermore, it gives me a chance to get feedback on my work, which would otherwise stay in (electronic) notebooks and never see the light of day[^fn2].

**Third**, I treat this as a sort of "long-term memory," where I can go back and quickly reference the things that I've spent time learning. I often find myself learning and re-learning the same subjects, so having things in this neat format helps to make that process more efficient.

With that being said, I hope you find some value in the things I write. ðŸ™‚
