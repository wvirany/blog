## Why the blog?

I initially started maintaining an academic page to host a portfolio where I could show off my projects to potential employers. However, it quickly turned into a small passion for writing about the things I'm working on. Now, I enjoy maintaining this blog for several reasons:

**First**, I often find myself looking for resources which dumb down complicated research topics so that I can understand them. I have benefitted substantially from other academic blogs on the internet, so I maintain this blog in an attempt to repay that debt to others.[^fn1]

**Second**, the act of writing down the things that I am currently working on in a polished format forces me to refine my understanding of the concepts. I find myself spending a lot more effort making sure I understand the things I am learning about before sharing them publicly on the internet.

**Third**, I treat this as a sort of "long-term memory," where I can go back and quickly reference the things that I've spent time learning. Before, I have often found myself learning and re-learning the same subjects, so having things in this neat format helps to make this process more efficient.

**Finally**, I am a believer of open-source science, and furthermore of making science more accessible to everyone. It is my hope that this blog makes a small contribution toward that goal.

That's all, hopefully you find some value in the things I write. ðŸ™‚
