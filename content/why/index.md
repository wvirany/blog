I initially created an academic page to host a portfolio where I could show off my projects to potential employers. However, it quickly turned into a small passion for writing about the things I'm working on. Now, I enjoy maintaining this blog for several reasons:

**First**, I often find myself looking for resources which dumb down complicated research topics or offer helpful career advice. I have benefitted substantially from other academic blogs on the internet, so I maintain this blog in an attempt to repay that debt to others[^fn1].

**Second**, the act of writing down the things that I am currently working on in a polished format forces me to refine my understanding of the concepts. I find myself spending a lot more effort making sure I understand the things I am learning about before sharing them publicly on the internet.

**Third**, I treat this as a sort of "long-term memory," where I can go back and quickly reference the things that I've spent time learning. I often find myself learning and re-learning the same subjects, so having things in this neat format helps to make that process more efficient.

<!-- **Finally**, I like to communicate scientific concepts. I am a believer of open-source science, and furthermore of making science more accessible to everyone. It is my hope that this blog makes a small contribution toward that goal. -->

With that being said, I hope you find some value in the things I write. ðŸ™‚
